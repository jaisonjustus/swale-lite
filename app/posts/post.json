Bayeux is a protocol for transfering data asynchronously between server-client with lower latency. Protocol is meant to support responsive bidirectional interaction between server-client, client-client through server. Bayeux is based on publish subscribe routing semantics. Delivery of asynchronous messages from the server to a web client is often described as server-push. The combination of server push techniques with an Ajax web application has been called Comet. CometD is a project by the Dojo Foundation to provide multiple implementation of the Bayeux protocol in several programming languages.",
